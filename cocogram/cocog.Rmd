within a hyper- dimensional conceptual space giving rise to emergent constructions,
which are then extendable as needed for the purpose of communication.

# (III) Cognitive Organization

different models are proposed in relation to how information is stored in the taxonomies.

- full-entry/usage-based/default inheritance/complete inheritance model ......
- since the late nineties there has been a shift towards a general preference for the usage-based model. The shift towards the usage-based approach in CxG has inspired several the development of corpus-based methodologies of constructional analysis.


> The usage-based model is based on inductive learning, meaning that linguistic knowledge is acquired in a bottom-up manner through use. It allows for redundancy and generalizations, because the language user generalizes over recurring experiences of use.

語意與情緒

> Experiences of emotions may be included as conceptual archetypes that provide the cognitive foundation for linking basic grammatical constructs with semantic categorization (Langacker, 1999)

- Emotions are *forces* and emotional experiences are *causal-evaluative events*. This also explains that conventionalized expressions of emotion are highly metaphorical and metonymic in nature, pertaining to embodied experiences of physiological reactions. 


- <font color=#0000FF>Emotional predicates</font> (aka. *mental verbs, verbs of psychological state*,  or *psych-verbs*, *psychological predicates*, *verbs of affect*) refer to the class of lemmas that encode a state or an event involving an internal, affective experience.

- 一個 synset 是由至少一個 form (lemma)-meaning (sense) pair 組成

- `Lexicon` vs `ConstructIcon`: the latter "including words, partially filled words (aka morphemes), and representations that are larger than single words, all represented in a complex dynamic network, much as we have long known to be true of the lexicon."
