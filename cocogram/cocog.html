&gt; Construction grammar (often abbreviated CxG) is a sociobiological family of theories within the field of cognitive and evolutionary linguistics. These posit that human language consists of constructions, or learned pairings of linguistic forms with meanings. (wiki)


--

&gt; .font90[ `\(C\)` is a CONSTRUCTION iff def `\(C\)` is a form–meaning pair `\(&lt;F_{i}, S_{i}&gt;\)` such
that some aspect of `\(F_{i}\)` or some aspect of `\(S_{i}\)` is not strictly predictable from
`\(C\)`'s component parts or from other previously established constructions (Goldberg, &lt;font color ="blue"&gt;1995&lt;/font&gt;).]


--
&gt; .font90[ Any linguistic pattern is recognized as a construction as long as some aspect
of its form or function is not strictly predictable from its component parts or
from other constructions recognized to exist. In addition, patterns are stored
as constructions even if they are fully predictable as long as they occur with

**collocations** (`hermetically sealed'), **(idiomatic) expressions with fixed constituents** ('kick the bucket'), **expressions with (semi-) optional constituents** ('hungry as a X'), and **sequences of grammatical categories** ([det][adj][noun]), as well as more complex constructions involving, e.g., the occurrence of **sentence composition features** (e.g. transitivity) or

哲學與認知前提

- bottom-up, usage-based .font70[浮現語法觀], self-adaptive /complex system

&gt; emphasizes that exemplars— structured representations— cluster
within a hyper-dimensional conceptual space giving rise to emergent constructions,
which are then extendable as needed for the purpose of communication.

.font70[單層級，不推導。句法現象不是由生成規則運算而生的副產品（如被動不是由主動推導出來）]

as unique encounters gives way to an emergent cluster (or “cloud”), which

- Semantics is based on speakers' `construals` of situations, not on objective truth conditions.

  - since the late nineties there has been a shift towards a general preference for the usage-based model. The shift towards the usage-based approach in CxG has inspired several the development of corpus-based methodologies of constructional analysis.


&gt; The usage-based model is based on inductive learning, meaning that linguistic knowledge is acquired in a bottom-up manner through use. It allows for redundancy and generalizations, because the language user generalizes over recurring experiences of use.

語意與情緒

&gt; Experiences of emotions may be included as conceptual archetypes that provide the cognitive foundation for linking basic grammatical constructs with semantic categorization (Langacker, 1999)

- Emotions are *forces* and emotional experiences are *causal-evaluative events*. This also explains that conventionalized expressions of emotion are highly metaphorical and metonymic in nature, pertaining to embodied experiences of physiological reactions. 


- &lt;font color=#0000FF&gt;Emotional predicates&lt;/font&gt; (aka. *mental verbs, verbs of psychological state*,  or *psych-verbs*, *psychological predicates*, *verbs of affect*) refer to the class of lemmas that encode a state or an event involving an internal, affective experience.

&gt; Construction grammar (often abbreviated CxG) is a sociobiological family of theories within the field of cognitive and evolutionary linguistics. These posit that human language consists of constructions, or learned pairings of linguistic forms with meanings. Constructions correspond to replicators or memes in memetics and other cultural replicator theories. It is argued that construction grammar is not an original model of cultural evolution, but for essential part the same as memetics.

&gt; Given (1) the obviously *multifaceted* nature of language and its relation to, or interaction with cognitive processing and (2) the complexity and noisiness of data obtained from corpora, it is often necessary to resort to statistical methods that can do better justice to the observed data.

怎麼量度 **idiomaticity** on the basis of 
  - experimental data (e.g., judgment data from subjects using the magnitude estimation method)
  - corpus data (by operationalizing different dimensions of idiomaticity, such as `collocational overlap` and idiomatic `variation parameters` (describing morphological and syntactic parameters of the idioms's use)

How to identify **prototypical instances of constructions**?

- Use a linear discriminant analysis to determine which characteristics were good predictors of the constructional choices in the corpus data (Gries, 2003). Each corpus instance was assigned a discriminant score that reveals how good, or prototipical, an example of ... is.

&lt;br&gt;
- 構式語法與當代認知科學發現的關聯應該是正相關

- 語料庫語言學做出了共現現象的計量觀察與顯著檢定嘗試（至少在經驗基礎上提供了 Exploratory Data Analysis 的計算環境）

但，如果構式不僅是作為一種 add-on 的語言(處理)資源，而是提供理論的基礎時，計算構式 (CoCoGram) 應該如何發生？

# [1] 構式如何辨識 ｜ form identification

- 詞彙也許是相對穩定的構式，但從單純計量角度是矛盾的。&lt;br&gt;
corpus-based counting of occurrence and co-occurrence seems straightforward, but require tokenization (thus assumes its boundary decision)

- 靜態語料庫難以處理 dispersion 的問題  &lt;br&gt;
aggregating token frequencies can be misleading since tokens may exhibit very uneven distributions in a corpus (and real contexts).


&gt; Frequency answers " how often does *x* happen?" whereas dispersion asks "in how many contexts will you encounter *x* at all?" (Ellis and Gries, 2015)

# 構式語法如何表徵語意 | meaning representation

---

(Usage-based perspective)

- Meaning = semantics, pragmatics, discourse-functions, ...

- Mental meaning is **construal** (not truth semantics), and most prominent framework is **Frame semantics** (Fillmore).
  - encyclopedic knowledge involved.
  - or, part of mental meaning is Frame.

- So, constructions as &lt;font color=#0000FF&gt; construals of frames &lt;/font&gt;
  - interaction of verbal frame (event type and participants) and **Argument Structure** (VAC).

# 在計算語言學界難被注意
The task of &lt;font color=#0000FF&gt;form-function contingency learning&lt;/font&gt; has
mostly been overlooked in NLP.

- 難處不僅在於 form 的 type/token indentification，而在 meaning 的對應 (contingency of mapping) 是如何知道的。

- 一形多義 (polysemy; multiple related senses) 與一形多用 (polyfunctionality/polycategoriality) 造成的歧義問題 &lt;br&gt;
cues with multiple interpretations are hard to resolve

- 都發生在使用/脈絡中。

# 想法

COCOGram aims to operationalize insights and analyses from construction grammar as computational processing models.

It does not only allow for automatic validation of the preciseness and consistency of construction grammar models, and to run these models on text corpora, but also to make use of construction grammar insights to enhance the performance of language technology applications.

# Proposal

&gt; Like words, (grammatical) constructions invite learners/speakers to form categories

語言資源的優先意義：人 EDA and 機 gold standard

- 同時做 `CWN` (wordnet) 與 `CCN` (construtionNet)
  - `word` 是較穩定的 `construction`
  - CWN 底層預設核心是 **synset**, CCN 是 **argument structure construction (ASC, Goldberg 1992)**.

- 一個 synset 是由至少一個 form (lemma)-meaning (sense) pair 組成

- `Lexicon` vs `ConstructIcon`: the latter "including words, partially filled words (aka morphemes), and representations that are larger than single words, all represented in a complex dynamic network, much as we have long known to be true of the lexicon."  

- 應用先選擇情緒分析

但值得嗎？

# Steps

- [top-down] compile an (incomplete) list of ASCs in Mandarin (modelled on English, cf. Goldberg 2019:p35);
similar to `constructionalized ontology` (as opposed to `lexicalied ontology`).

- [bottom-up] manual selection with corpus check (Entropy or other measures?)
