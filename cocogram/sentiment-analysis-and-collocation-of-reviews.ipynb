Humans agree on the sentiment of sentences only 80% of the time, and the best classifiers can get around that level of accuracy, but we're going to just use a built-in analyzer in the `nltk` (natural language toolkit) Python library.\n",

    "The basic `nltk` sentiment analysis built-in did not do a good job analyzing the sentiments in our sample of AirBnB reviews. Without knowing more details about how the classifier was trained (there is a paper you can read FYI) I can't say for sure why that is, exactly, but it's nevertheless an interesting limitation to keep in mind, as most Internet review texts are going to be pretty similar to the AirBnB one. Perhaps other analyzers would do a better job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collocation with `nltk`, on the other hand, worked brilliantly! It turns out to be something that's pretty easy to do but which generates reasonably good results with just a little bit of elbow grease. You can apply this technique to just about about any reservoir of review texts out there, so keep it in mind because it's a useful tool to have under your belt!"
